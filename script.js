His presence was heavier than gravity itself — a darkness that crushed even light beneath its will. For a thousand years, he had slept beneath the cosmic depths, waiting for mankind’s arrogance to summon him again.\n\nThe five warriors stood upon the edge of existence, their hearts unwavering, their Astras gleaming with divine power. Before them shimmered five layers of protection — the seals of the Asura — each a test beyond imagination.\n\nThe first layer was silence. The second layer came as furious wind. Then came fire — molten, living, alive with divine vengeance. The fourth barrier erupted as thunder and lightning. And finally, a veil of creation itself pulsed before them.\n\nAsura’s laughter tore through the silence: “You think you’ve broken my shields? You’ve merely awakened me!”\n\nBut suddenly, the heavens darkened. The Almighty Asura unleashed his full wrath, eyes blazing like molten stars, and shadows fell across the world.

The five warriors stood before an altar of forgotten gods, their hearts burning with resolve.\n\nThe first seal was no wind nor flame, but a blaze that refused to be tamed — fire that spoke of chaos and cleansing. When the flames subsided, the silence that followed carried whispers of the sky. Far beyond, a light shimmered within a dark sphere — creation bound in destruction. But the next barrier was merciless. Bolts of thunder tore across the sky. And then came the stillness — the first veil reborn.\n\nFrom the depths of the storm, the Asura’s laughter echoed — “Fools! You wield what was forged in my own rage. Every spark you command was once born of my fury.”\n\nBut suddenly, the heavens darkened.

When the light faded, silence consumed the earth. But beneath the silence lay creation itself — the source of life and unmaking. And when the flames finally returned, they burned differently — not to consume, but to purify.\n\nAmid the thunder, the Asura’s voice rolled like doom — “You think yourselves chosen? I have broken gods before you were born. The sky itself bends to my will.”\n\nBut suddenly, the heavens darkened.
